# This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
# Time Slot Scheduler

-When one time slot is clicked, a modal pops up which asks for name and phone number.
-When the name and phone number is submitted, the time slot selected changes to
red, indicating the time slot is no longer available.
-If the red time slot is clicked on again, the modal will pop up with the name and phone
number for that appointment prepopulated.  Users will be able to edit the name and
phone number to change the user for the appointment.
